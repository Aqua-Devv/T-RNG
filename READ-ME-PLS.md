hey hello guys, probably a desperate name isnt it? LOL
Anyways, i wanna say that u should run the file from the TERMINAL and NOT the cmd because the cmd doesnt have colors :'(

Heres how you can do that:
In the terminal, go to the directory your file is located in and do ./gmblpy.exe , now its gonna have colors for each rarity :)
Hope u enjoy guys <3
